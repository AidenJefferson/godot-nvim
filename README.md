# Neovim as a Godot editor

So you dont forget Aiden, the instructions are

    Editor -> Editor Settings -> Dotnet -> Editor

    set External Editor to Custom
    set Custom Exec Path to the location of this script
    set Custom Exec Path Args to {file}


Why use VSCode when you could spend 3 hours trying to write whatever the 
bloody hell applescript is to try and get something to work.
